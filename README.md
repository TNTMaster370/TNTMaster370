### Hello, world!

My name is Trystyn CotÃ©, and I'm a Computer Science student based in Canada. My primary goal with 
programming is to hone my skills and make things that I feel are meaningful. I mostly write programs
in Python, but I intend to learn and practice C/C++ at some point in the future. Hope to see you 
around!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Scrivid](https://github.com/TNTMaster370/scrivid), a Python package
for generating instructional videos.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Contact me via my email address, `trystynmcote@gmail.com`. Any spam or
promotional emails will be deleted and the sender will be blocked accordingly.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have my own [Code-Style sheet](https://github.com/TNTMaster370/TNTMaster370/blob/main/CODESTYLE.md)
that acts as an extension to PEP 8.
