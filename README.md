### Hello, world!

My name is Trystyn CotÃ©, and I'm a Computer Science student based in Canada. My primary goal with 
programming is to hone my skills and make things that I feel are meaningful. I mostly write programs
in Python, but I intend to learn and practice C/C++ at some point in the future. Hope to see you 
around!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Scrivid](https://github.com/trystyncote/scrivid), a Python package
for generating animation-like videos.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Contact me via my email address, `trystynmcote@gmail.com`.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have created an extension [Code-Style sheet](https://github.com/trystyncote/trystyncote/blob/main/CODESTYLE.md) to cover details that PEP 8 doesn't.
